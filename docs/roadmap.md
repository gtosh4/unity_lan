# UnityLAN — Roadmap (Milestones & Tasks)

Task breakdown of the milestones in [design.md §11](./design.md). Each milestone has a
**goal**, **tasks**, and a **verify** (done-when). Build in order; later milestones assume
earlier ones.

## M1 — Membership spine (no WG, no GUI)
**Goal:** prove authenticated, signed, role-derived membership end to end. Engine prints a
verified `wg_ip` + hostname obtained from the coordinator.

### M1.0 Workspace
- [ ] Cargo workspace `Cargo.toml`; crates `common`, `coordinator`, `engine` (+ `gui` stub later).
- [ ] Shared workspace deps (tokio, serde, tracing) via `[workspace.dependencies]`.
- [ ] `.gitignore` for `/target`, secrets, `*.db`.

### M1.1 `common` (pure, unit-tested — no network)
- [ ] `crypto.rs`: Ed25519 keypair, `sign`/`verify` (ed25519-dalek); WG key types (x25519-dalek).
- [ ] `wire.rs`: `Signed<T>` envelope, postcard encode/decode, base64 transport form.
- [ ] `attestation.rs`: `Attestation` struct (serde) + `verify(anchor, now)`.
- [ ] `netid.rs`: `subnet_of(guild,role)`, `host_hint(user)`, `sanitize_label`, siphash.
- [ ] `api.rs`: coordinator DTOs (`RegisterReq/Resp`, `SeedRecord`, `RefreshReq/Resp`).
- [ ] **Tests**: sign→verify round-trip; tamper → fail; TTL expiry → fail; subnet in `100.64/10`.

### M1.2 `coordinator`
- [ ] `config.rs`: TOML (guild_id, bot_token, oauth client id/secret + redirect, role→network
      allowlist, bind addr, db path, signing-key path).
- [ ] `store.rs`: SQLite via sqlx — `allocations`, `signing_key`, `tombstones`; migrations.
- [ ] `signer.rs`: load/generate Ed25519 key; `sign_attestation(user, role, …, ttl=30m)`.
- [ ] `discord.rs`: twilight-http `GET member` → roles + nick.
- [ ] `oauth.rs`: Discord OAuth2 auth-code + PKCE; exchange code → `user_id` (`identify`).
- [ ] `alloc.rs`: allocate stable `wg_ip` per `(guild,role,user)`; persist; collision-resolve.
- [ ] `api.rs` (axum): `GET /oauth/start`, `GET /oauth/callback`, `POST /register`.
- [ ] `main.rs`: load config, open store, serve.

### M1.3 `engine` (headless)
- [ ] `config.rs` + state dir (0600).
- [ ] `auth.rs`: loopback OAuth (return authorize URL, catch redirect → session token).
- [ ] gen WG keypair (private stays local).
- [ ] `coord.rs`: `POST /register{wg_pubkey}` → attestations + `coord_pubkey`; **verify** sig +
      TTL; **pin** anchor.
- [ ] `main.rs`: run once → print each `wg_ip` + `<nick>.<role>.<guild>.internal`.

**Verify:** against a test Discord guild, engine logs a signature-verified attestation and
prints e.g. `alice.minecraft.myguild.internal → 100.64.42.7`. Tamper the payload → engine
rejects.
> ⚙️ Needs from you: a Discord application (client id/secret), a bot token in the test guild,
> and a role or two. (Setup steps documented when we reach M1.2.)

## M2 — WireGuard backend + control socket
**Goal:** engine can bring up an interface and add/remove peers; GUI-less control channel.
- [x] `wg/mod.rs`: `WgBackend` trait (`up`, `set_peer`, `remove_peer`, `down`).
- [x] `wg/userspace.rs`: defguard/boringtun userspace backend (portable primary).
- [x] Bring up an interface with the client's `/32`; add a peer; **ping over the tunnel**
      (`scripts/wg-tunnel-test.sh` — two netns + veth, no host root; PASS).
- [x] engine dev subcommands: `wg-smoke`, `wg-keygen`, `wg-node`.
- [x] `control.rs`: local-socket server (tokio `UnixListener`, newline-JSON) + `ctl status` CLI
      — shows device (ip/hostname/primary/networks) + peers (ip/hostname/endpoint). Windows
      named-pipe (`interprocess`) is a later transport swap. Done as part of M-device 6.
- [ ] ⚠️ **Spike**: confirm `defguard_wireguard_rs` userspace path on **Windows + macOS**
      (Linux userspace confirmed working).

**Verify:** ✅ real encrypted tunnel carries ICMP across two namespaces, 0% loss
(`scripts/wg-tunnel-test.sh`). Control socket + `status` still pending.

---

## M3 — Mesh formation
**Goal:** members auto-discover and mesh; new joiner bootstraps via any online member.

### M3a — Seed-based meshing (done)
- [x] Coordinator presence + `seeds` in `/register`; `/refresh` endpoint + client endpoint report.
- [x] Engine daemon (`run`): register → bring up iface with its `/32`s → peer seeds →
      refresh loop picking up new co-members.
- [x] Daemon brings its own link admin-up (Linux `ip link set up`; netlink/ioctl later) so
      defguard installs routes automatically — meshes with **no external plumbing**.
- [x] `scripts/mesh-test.sh`: coordinator + two engine daemons in separate netns mesh and
      ping across — **PASS**, no host root, no manual link-up/routes.

### M3b — P2P gossip (attempted, deferred)
Prototyped a bidirectional gossip exchange over the mesh, then reverted. **Finding:** gossip
runs *over* WG tunnels, and WireGuard needs **reciprocal** peer knowledge to open a tunnel
(a peer drops handshakes from pubkeys it hasn't been told about). So a node can only gossip
with peers that already know it — gossip cannot bootstrap discovery of a peer that doesn't
know you. The coordinator's full-seed `/register` is therefore the real discovery mechanism
(and it already yields a full reciprocal mesh). Gossip's remaining value here is only
endpoint-freshness + less coordinator polling — marginal — and the prototype had a 3-node
convergence bug. **Deferred** until there's a concrete need (e.g. very large meshes, or
frequent roaming) and a reciprocity-aware bootstrap (ring/hub seed selection).

**Verify (M3a):** ✅ two daemons mesh via coordinator seeds and ping across
(`scripts/mesh-test.sh`).

---

## M-device — Device model, addressing & naming (supersedes old per-network addressing)
Reshapes M1/M3 addressing to the settled **Model B** (design §6). Build order:
1. **One IP per device** ✅ — allocation keyed by device pubkey in a flat `100.64/10`
   (`netid`: `device_hint`/`pick_free_index`/`addr_from_index`; `devices` table by pubkey);
   attestation carries `device_name` + `username` + `is_primary`; presence keyed by device
   pubkey (a user's multiple devices no longer collide); networks are pure ACL — seeds = anyone
   sharing ≥1 network. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` meshes with per-device IPs (0% loss).
2. **Enrollment** — one-time enrollment keys (headless) ✅: `enrollment_keys` table (one-time,
   optional expiry, bound to a pubkey on use); `resolve_user` = known device by pubkey, else
   consume a key; minted via `/unitylan enroll` (any member, ephemeral) or config seed for tests.
   Replaced `dev_auth`/`?dev_user=`. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` enrolls + meshes; store tests cover
   one-time/expiry/rejection. OAuth session (interactive) still TODO — reuses the same binding.
3. **Community slug** ✅ — `communities` table (guild → slug); admin config via `[[community]]`
   seed, default = guild name; threaded into `Grant.community_name`. Runtime setter command
   deferred to the management chunk. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` shows `<device>.<user>.lan.internal`.
4. **Primary device** ✅ — `primary_device` table (one per user; simpler than per-community —
   the alias resolves the same everywhere). First enrollment auto-assigns; owner reassigns via
   `/unitylan primary set <device>` (`list` shows them). `is_primary` computed at register and
   propagated through the attestation → `SelfDevice`. CLI/GUI setter lands with the control
   socket (chunk 6). Verified: store test (auto-assign/reassign) + `mesh-test.sh` shows
   `[primary]`. The `<user>.<community>` alias itself is served in chunk 5 (DNS).
5. **DNS** ✅ — engine `dns.rs`: a tiny authoritative UDP resolver (hickory-proto) serving the
   `.internal` zone from verified attestations (self + seeds). Answers `<device>.<user>.<community>`
   and the `<user>.<community>` primary alias; NXDOMAIN for unknown `.internal`; EDNS-compatible.
   Zone rebuilt each refresh; enabled via `dns_bind`. Seeds now carry `community_name` so peer
   hostnames are well-defined. Per-OS resolver hookup (resolved/NRPT/macOS) deferred to polish.
   Verified: `mesh-test.sh` digs node A's resolver → peer B's name + primary alias → B's IP; two
   engine unit tests (answer + socket).
6. **Device management** — ✅
   - [x] Control socket (engine daemon serves it) + `ctl status` CLI (read-only): live device +
     peers snapshot, updated each refresh. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` runs `ctl status` on node A →
     lists peer B's ip/hostname/endpoint.
   - [x] Mutations: rename / set-primary / remove over the socket → coordinator, authenticated
     by a **per-device bearer token** minted at enrollment (`devices.token`, returned in
     `RegisterResp`, persisted 0600 in `state_dir/token`). Coordinator maps token→device→user and
     executes owner-scoped ops; remove auto-promotes a new primary. `ctl rename|set-primary|remove`.
     (Token secrecy relies on TLS in prod + local perms; a signed-request upgrade can come later.)
   - [x] `devices` list (`ctl devices` → `ManageOp::List`).
   - [x] iced GUI frontend — see M4.
7. **Discovery: long-poll + version/ETag** — ✅ (supersedes M3 gossip). `/refresh` carries the
   client's last-seen `version`; the coordinator holds an up-to-date request until presence
   changes (a `tokio::watch` version bump wakes parked peers at once) or ~TTL/2 elapses (renewal
   re-signs attestations). Near-zero idle traffic; joins propagate near-instantly. Rationale +
   scale envelope (eager peering at target scale; gossip/lazy-peering/deltas as the >~1k
   escape hatch) in design.md §5. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` (2/2 — B's join wakes A's long-poll).

## M4 — iced GUI
**Goal:** a real desktop app driving the engine over the control socket.
- [x] `gui` crate: iced app (State/Message/update/view) with a 2s `Subscription` timer refresh.
- [x] Async control-socket client (shared `common::control` DTOs; GUI needs no engine dep).
- [x] Screens: live status (this device + peers) and device management (rename / set-primary /
      remove) — exactly what the control socket backs today. `unitylan-gui [control.sock]`.
- [x] `expose` / `unexpose` / exposed-ports list — added in M7d (the engine now backs them over
      the control socket).
- [x] **Networks list + per-network peering toggle** — a device can enable/disable peering on
      each of its networks (role@guild) from the GUI (or `ctl net enable|disable <network>`).
      Coordinator-side, symmetric opt-out (`network_optout` table keyed by device pubkey; excluded
      from presence/grant/seeds both ways; version-bumped so peers prune at once). `RegisterResp`
      + `StatusReport` carry `NetworkStatus` (guild/role/name/enabled). Verified:
      `scripts/net-toggle-test.sh` (3 nodes/2 nets — A disables mesh2 → drops C both ways, keeps B;
      re-enable → C returns) + store/GUI unit tests.
- [ ] Login (OAuth), tray — deferred: the engine doesn't yet back these over the socket
      (post-M5).

**Verify:** 4 reducer unit tests (status/devices/error/rename paths); launch smoke (window +
wgpu/tiny-skia renderer + timer subscription + async socket task boot clean). The socket
protocol itself is the same one `mesh-test.sh` exercises via the `ctl` CLI.

---

## M5 — NAT traversal
**Goal:** reach members behind NAT.
- [ ] `nat.rs`: UPnP-IGD port mapping; publish mapped endpoint.
- [ ] Mesh-relayed hole punch: relay peer passes endpoints + synchronized punch signal.
- [ ] Diagnostics for symmetric-NAT-both (best-effort, clear error).

**Verify:** two NAT'd hosts (no port-forward) mesh via a mutually-connected relay peer.

---

## M6 — DNS + multi-homing
**Goal:** `*.internal` names resolve; overlapping networks work on one interface.
- [ ] `dns.rs`: hickory-server `.internal` zone from verified attestations.
- [ ] Per-OS hookup: resolved/resolv.conf · Windows NRPT/netsh · macOS resolver dir; hosts fallback.
- [ ] One interface, per-role `/32`s; verify cross-network isolation.

**Verify:** `ping alice.minecraft.myguild.internal` resolves + reaches; a member in two roles
gets two names/IPs; the networks can't route to each other.

---

## M7 — Revocation, expose, status polish
**Goal:** losing a role cuts you off; expose local ports; solid status.

### M7a — Revocation core ✅
- [x] **Client prune**: `apply_seeds` removes peers absent from the current seed set (was
      add-only). A revoked/departed co-member drops out of the coordinator's presence → its
      next-absent refresh removes the peer + reinstalls routing. Grant→None mid-loop (own role
      lost) prunes every peer, isolating us.
- [x] **Coordinator stop-signing + self-eviction**: `build_snapshot` skips networks the caller
      no longer holds (no grant/seed) *and* evicts the caller's stale presence from any network
      it dropped, bumping the version so parked long-polls wake and prune. `Presence::evict` /
      `evict_user` / `networks_of` (unit-tested).
- [x] Client TTL refresh at half-life — already via the long-poll hold (~TTL/2); revocation
      propagates on the next woken refresh.
- **Verify:** ✅ `mesh-test.sh` — after the mesh pings, node B's role is stripped and the
  coordinator restarts; node A prunes peer B (log + `ctl status` no longer lists it).

### M7b — Live gateway revocation (immediate, prod trigger) ✅
- [x] Gateway `MEMBER_UPDATE`/`MEMBER_REMOVE` (GUILD_MEMBERS intent) → `presence.evict_user` for
      every network whose role the member no longer holds + version bump → parked long-polls wake
      and prune instantly, even when the revoked node is offline. `presence`/`version` wired into
      the gateway task. Verified-by-construction (compiles against twilight's event model); no
      headless test — needs a live Discord guild.
- [ ] Optional persisted tombstones (survive coordinator restart before the live role re-check) —
      deferred: the live role re-check on re-register already blocks a revoked member.

### M7c — expose (enforcing firewall)
- [x] **Firewall core** ✅ — `FirewallBackend` trait + Linux nftables backend (`inet unitylan`,
      atomic `nft -f -` load). Default-deny new inbound on the wg iface; allow established/related
      + ICMP echo; accept only exposed ports. On by default (`firewall = true`); fail-closed at
      startup if nft errors. Backend-agnostic so Windows WFP / macOS pf drop in later (both kernel
      and userspace WG deliver decrypted packets through the OS stack, so the rules are identical).
- [x] `ctl expose <port> [tcp|udp]` / `unexpose` / `exposes` over the control socket → `Firewall`
      reconciles the whole ruleset; config `[[expose]]` seeds initial ports. Clean shutdown
      (ctrl_c) tears the table down.
- **Verify:** ✅ `mesh-test.sh` firewall phase — 9001 blocked by default-deny, reachable after
      `ctl expose 9001`, never-exposed 9002 stays blocked, blocked again after `unexpose`; ping
      (ICMP) survives throughout. Plus 2 nft ruleset unit tests.
- [x] **`--net <role>` source scoping** ✅ (M7c-2): `expose <port> --net <role>` opens the port
      only to that network's peers. `Seed.networks` (per-peer shared-network names) added to the
      API; the client groups peer IPs per network (`peers_by_net`, refreshed each membership
      change) and nft emits a named `ipv4_addr` source set + `ip saddr @set … dport … accept`.
      `--net` is validated against the device's held networks. **Verify:** ✅
      `scripts/expose-net-test.sh` — 3 nodes / 2 nets (A∈{mesh,mesh2}, B∈mesh, C∈mesh2): B reaches
      A's mesh-scoped 9001 but not mesh2-scoped 9002; C the reverse; expose to a non-held network
      is rejected. Plus 2 nft scoped-ruleset unit tests.
- [ ] Windows WFP + macOS pf backends.

### M7d — status polish ✅
- [x] GUI surfaces the firewall: an **exposed ports** section (proto/port + `→ net:` scope) with
      per-row **unexpose** buttons and an **expose** row (port `25565` or `udp/34197`, optional
      net). Auto-refreshed on the 2s tick over the same control socket the CLI uses.
- [x] Revocation events show implicitly — a pruned peer drops out of the auto-refreshed peers
      list. **Verify:** 4 new GUI reducer tests (exposes list / valid submit clears inputs / bad
      port surfaces error / `parse_port`); launch smoke clean. 36 unit tests total.

---

## M8 — Native kernel backends (optimization)
**Goal:** faster path where the OS offers it.
- [ ] `wg/native.rs`: Linux netlink; Windows WireGuardNT (via defguard).
- [ ] Select native when present, else userspace; parity tests.

**Verify:** same behavior as userspace on Linux + Windows, measurably lower overhead.

---

## Cross-cutting (ongoing)
- [ ] `tracing` logging across binaries.
- [ ] Per-OS service packaging (systemd unit · Windows Service · launchd plist).
- [ ] CI: `cargo fmt`/`clippy`/`test`.
- [ ] Open design items to close before GA: coordinator key rotation, pubkey re-key signal,
      endpoint-record spoof hardening, symmetric-NAT policy (design.md Open Questions).
