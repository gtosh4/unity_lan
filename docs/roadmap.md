# UnityLAN — Roadmap (Milestones & Tasks)

Task breakdown of the milestones in [design.md §11](./design.md). Each milestone has a
**goal**, **tasks**, and a **verify** (done-when). Build in order; later milestones assume
earlier ones.

## M1 — Membership spine (no WG, no GUI)
**Goal:** prove authenticated, signed, role-derived membership end to end. Engine prints a
verified `wg_ip` + hostname obtained from the coordinator.

### M1.0 Workspace
- [x] Cargo workspace `Cargo.toml`; crates `common`, `coordinator`, `engine` (+ `gui` stub later).
- [x] Shared workspace deps (tokio, serde, tracing) via `[workspace.dependencies]`.
- [x] `.gitignore` for `/target`, secrets, `*.db`.

### M1.1 `common` (pure, unit-tested — no network)
- [x] `crypto.rs`: Ed25519 keypair, `sign`/`verify` (ed25519-dalek); WG key types (x25519-dalek).
- [x] `wire.rs`: `Signed<T>` envelope, postcard encode/decode, base64 transport form.
- [x] `attestation.rs`: `Attestation` struct (serde) + `verify(anchor, now)`.
- [x] `netid.rs`: `subnet_of(guild,role)`, `host_hint(user)`, `sanitize_label`, siphash.
- [x] `api.rs`: coordinator DTOs (`RegisterReq/Resp`, `SeedRecord`, `RefreshReq/Resp`).
- [x] **Tests**: sign→verify round-trip; tamper → fail; TTL expiry → fail; subnet in `100.64/10`.

### M1.2 `coordinator`
- [x] `config.rs`: TOML (guild_id, bot_token, oauth client id/secret + redirect, role→network
      allowlist, bind addr, db path, signing-key path).
- [x] `store.rs`: SQLite via sqlx — `allocations`, `signing_key`, `tombstones`; migrations.
- [x] `signer.rs`: load/generate Ed25519 key; `sign_attestation(user, role, …, ttl=30m)`.
- [x] `discord.rs`: twilight-http `GET member` → roles + nick.
- [x] `oauth.rs`: Discord OAuth2 auth-code + **PKCE** (engine is the public client, no secret);
      coordinator verifies the access token → `user_id` (`identify`). `FakeOauth` for offline tests.
- [x] IP allocation: stable per-device `wg_ip` in flat `100.64/10` — `store.rs::allocate_device_ip`
      (per-device keying superseded the old per-`(guild,role,user)` `alloc.rs` plan, see M-device ch1).
- [x] `api.rs` (axum): `GET /oauth/pkce-config`, `POST /oauth/complete`, `POST /register`.
- [x] `main.rs`: load config, open store, serve.

### M1.3 `engine` (headless)
- [x] `config.rs` + state dir (0600).
- [x] `auth.rs`: loopback OAuth (return authorize URL, catch redirect → session token).
- [x] gen WG keypair (private stays local).
- [x] `coord.rs`: `POST /register{wg_pubkey}` → attestations + `coord_pubkey`; **verify** sig +
      TTL; **pin** anchor.
- [x] `main.rs`: run once → print each `wg_ip` + `<nick>.<role>.<guild>.internal`.

**Verify:** against a test Discord guild, engine logs a signature-verified attestation and
prints e.g. `alice.minecraft.myguild.internal → 100.64.42.7`. Tamper the payload → engine
rejects.
> ⚙️ Needs from you: a Discord application (client id/secret), a bot token in the test guild,
> and a role or two. (Setup steps documented when we reach M1.2.)

---

## M2 — WireGuard backend + control socket
**Goal:** engine can bring up an interface and add/remove peers; GUI-less control channel.
- [x] `wg/mod.rs`: `WgBackend` trait (`up`, `set_peer`, `remove_peer`, `down`).
- [x] `wg/userspace.rs`: defguard/boringtun userspace backend (portable primary).
- [x] Bring up an interface with the client's `/32`; add a peer; **ping over the tunnel**
      (`scripts/wg-tunnel-test.sh` — two netns + veth, no host root; PASS).
- [x] engine dev subcommands: `wg-smoke`, `wg-keygen`, `wg-node`.
- [x] `control.rs`: local-socket server (newline-JSON) + `ctl status` CLI — shows device
      (ip/hostname/primary/networks) + peers (ip/hostname/endpoint). Done as part of M-device 6.
      **Windows named-pipe transport** landed (M-win): the transport is now `interprocess`'s
      cross-platform local socket (unix-domain socket on unix, named pipe on Windows); the endpoint
      is named by `Config::control_name` (path on unix, `unitylan-<stem>` pipe on Windows). The GUI
      client (`gui/src/ctl.rs`) uses the same transport + name convention.
- [x] ⚠️ **Spike** resolved (M-win): defguard's **userspace** path is unix-only; on **Windows** the
      supported path is `WGApi<Kernel>` (wireguard-nt), wired up as `wg/windows.rs` (see M8). macOS
      userspace still unconfirmed.

**Verify:** ✅ real encrypted tunnel carries ICMP across two namespaces, 0% loss
(`scripts/wg-tunnel-test.sh`). Control socket + `status` still pending.

---

## M3 — Mesh formation
**Goal:** members auto-discover and mesh; new joiner bootstraps via any online member.

### M3a — Seed-based meshing (done)
- [x] Coordinator presence + `seeds` in `/register`; `/refresh` endpoint + client endpoint report.
- [x] Engine daemon (`run`): register → bring up iface with its `/32`s → peer seeds →
      refresh loop picking up new co-members.
- [x] Daemon brings its own link admin-up (Linux `ip link set up`; netlink/ioctl later) so
      defguard installs routes automatically — meshes with **no external plumbing**.
- [x] `scripts/mesh-test.sh`: coordinator + two engine daemons in separate netns mesh and
      ping across — **PASS**, no host root, no manual link-up/routes.

### M3b — P2P gossip (attempted, deferred)
Prototyped a bidirectional gossip exchange over the mesh, then reverted. **Finding:** gossip
runs *over* WG tunnels, and WireGuard needs **reciprocal** peer knowledge to open a tunnel
(a peer drops handshakes from pubkeys it hasn't been told about). So a node can only gossip
with peers that already know it — gossip cannot bootstrap discovery of a peer that doesn't
know you. The coordinator's full-seed `/register` is therefore the real discovery mechanism
(and it already yields a full reciprocal mesh). Gossip's remaining value here is only
endpoint-freshness + less coordinator polling — marginal — and the prototype had a 3-node
convergence bug. **Deferred** until there's a concrete need (e.g. very large meshes, or
frequent roaming) and a reciprocity-aware bootstrap (ring/hub seed selection).

**Verify (M3a):** ✅ two daemons mesh via coordinator seeds and ping across
(`scripts/mesh-test.sh`).

---

## M-device — Device model, addressing & naming (supersedes old per-network addressing)
Reshapes M1/M3 addressing to the settled **Model B** (design §6). Build order:
1. **One IP per device** ✅ — allocation keyed by device pubkey in a flat `100.64/10`
   (`netid`: `device_hint`/`pick_free_index`/`addr_from_index`; `devices` table by pubkey);
   attestation carries `device_name` + `username` + `is_primary`; presence keyed by device
   pubkey (a user's multiple devices no longer collide); networks are pure ACL — seeds = anyone
   sharing ≥1 network. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` meshes with per-device IPs (0% loss).
2. **Enrollment** — one-time enrollment keys (headless) ✅: `enrollment_keys` table (one-time,
   optional expiry, bound to a pubkey on use); `resolve_user` = known device by pubkey, else
   consume a key; minted via `/unitylan enroll` (any member, ephemeral) or config seed for tests.
   Replaced `dev_auth`/`?dev_user=`. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` enrolls + meshes; store tests cover
   one-time/expiry/rejection. OAuth session (interactive) still TODO — reuses the same binding.
3. **Community slug** ✅ — `communities` table (guild → slug); admin config via `[[community]]`
   seed, default = guild name; threaded into `Grant.community_name`. Runtime setter command
   deferred to the management chunk. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` shows `<device>.<user>.lan.internal`.
4. **Primary device** ✅ — `primary_device` table (one per user; simpler than per-community —
   the alias resolves the same everywhere). First enrollment auto-assigns; owner reassigns via
   `/unitylan primary set <device>` (`list` shows them). `is_primary` computed at register and
   propagated through the attestation → `SelfDevice`. CLI/GUI setter lands with the control
   socket (chunk 6). Verified: store test (auto-assign/reassign) + `mesh-test.sh` shows
   `[primary]`. The `<user>.<community>` alias itself is served in chunk 5 (DNS).
5. **DNS** ✅ — engine `dns.rs`: a tiny authoritative UDP resolver (hickory-proto) serving the
   `.internal` zone from verified attestations (self + seeds). Answers `<device>.<user>.<community>`
   and the `<user>.<community>` primary alias; NXDOMAIN for unknown `.internal`; EDNS-compatible.
   Zone rebuilt each refresh; enabled via the `dns` flag. Seeds now carry `community_name` so peer
   hostnames are well-defined. Per-OS resolver hookup (resolved/NRPT/macOS) deferred to polish.
   Verified: `mesh-test.sh` digs node A's resolver → peer B's name + primary alias → B's IP; two
   engine unit tests (answer + socket).
6. **Device management** — ✅
   - [x] Control socket (engine daemon serves it) + `ctl status` CLI (read-only): live device +
     peers snapshot, updated each refresh. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` runs `ctl status` on node A →
     lists peer B's ip/hostname/endpoint.
   - [x] Mutations: rename / set-primary / remove over the socket → coordinator, authenticated
     by a **per-device bearer token** minted at enrollment (`devices.token`, returned in
     `RegisterResp`, persisted 0600 in `state_dir/token`). Coordinator maps token→device→user and
     executes owner-scoped ops; remove auto-promotes a new primary. `ctl rename|set-primary|remove`.
     (Token secrecy relies on TLS in prod + local perms; a signed-request upgrade can come later.)
   - [x] `devices` list (`ctl devices` → `ManageOp::List`).
   - [x] iced GUI frontend — see M4.
7. **Discovery: long-poll + version/ETag** — ✅ (supersedes M3 gossip). `/refresh` carries the
   client's last-seen `version`; the coordinator holds an up-to-date request until presence
   changes (a `tokio::watch` version bump wakes parked peers at once) or ~TTL/2 elapses (renewal
   re-signs attestations). Near-zero idle traffic; joins propagate near-instantly. Rationale +
   scale envelope (eager peering at target scale; gossip/lazy-peering/deltas as the >~1k
   escape hatch) in design.md §5. Verified: `mesh-test.sh` (2/2 — B's join wakes A's long-poll).

## M4 — iced GUI
**Goal:** a real desktop app driving the engine over the control socket.
- [x] `gui` crate: iced app (State/Message/update/view) with a 2s `Subscription` timer refresh.
- [x] Async control-socket client (shared `common::control` DTOs; GUI needs no engine dep).
- [x] Screens: live status (this device + peers) and device management (rename / set-primary /
      remove) — exactly what the control socket backs today. `unitylan-gui [control.sock]`.
- [x] **Mesh connect / disconnect** — the GUI's primary on/off is a mesh **connect/disconnect** over
      the control socket (`ControlRequest::SetConnected`), *not* a Windows-service stop. Disconnect
      keeps the engine resident and still long-polling (so reconnect is instant) but drops the local
      peer-set (interface stays up holding our `/32`) **and** withdraws us from every co-member's seed
      list so peers prune us and see us offline. **Client is the source of truth**: a global paused
      flag persisted separately (`<state_dir>/paused.json`), layered *on top of* the per-network
      opt-out (so a connect/disconnect cycle never clobbers individual per-network prefs), enforced
      locally (empty active seed set) so it works while the coordinator is **unreachable** — the
      toggle wakes the daemon (`tokio::Notify`) to tear down / re-mesh from the last snapshot at once.
      It rides to the coordinator as `RegisterReq.paused`, which skips recording the device's presence
      and evicts any existing (peers wake on the version bump and prune), while still returning the
      device's own grant (its IP) + seeds so reconnect re-meshes instantly. `StatusReport.connected`
      surfaces the state; `ctl connect|disconnect` is the CLI. The engine **Windows service stays
      resident** (auto-start); the GUI keeps only a **start** affordance for the stopped case (no
      socket to talk to until it's running) — routine stop/restart is gone (mesh disconnect replaces
      it). Verified: `netcfg` pause-persistence test + 2 GUI reducer tests (connect busy/clears,
      status carries connection state).
- [x] `expose` / `unexpose` / exposed-ports list — added in M7d (the engine now backs them over
      the control socket).
- [x] **Networks list + per-network peering toggle** — a device can enable/disable peering on
      each of its networks (role@guild) from the GUI (or `ctl net enable|disable <network>`).
      **Client is the source of truth**: the opt-out set is persisted locally
      (`<state_dir>/network_optout.json`) and enforced by filtering seeds, so it works even when
      the coordinator is **unreachable** — a toggle wakes the daemon (`tokio::Notify`) to re-mesh
      from the last snapshot at once. The set rides along in every `RegisterReq.disabled_networks`;
      the coordinator mirrors it (excludes those from presence/grant/seeds both ways) → symmetric
      when reachable, auto-syncs on reconnect. `RegisterResp`/`StatusReport` carry `NetworkStatus`
      (guild/role/name/enabled). Verified: `scripts/net-toggle-test.sh` (3 nodes/2 nets — online:
      A disables mesh2 → drops C both ways, keeps B, re-enable → C returns; **offline**:
      coordinator killed → `ctl net disable` still succeeds and A drops C locally) + GUI unit tests.
- [x] **Interactive login (OAuth)** — `unitylan login <config>` runs Discord OAuth2 **auth-code +
      PKCE**: the engine is the **public client** — it fetches `client_id` from `/oauth/pkce-config`,
      binds a fixed loopback listener (`oauth_redirect`, registered once with the app), exchanges the
      code itself with a `code_verifier` (no secret), and hands the coordinator the access token via
      `/oauth/complete`. The coordinator verifies it (`GET /users/@me`) and binds pubkey→user in
      `oauth_authorized`; `resolve_user` accepts an OAuth-bound device. Because the redirect is
      loopback, login works from any host/VM without a reachable coordinator URL (needs the app's
      `PUBLIC_OAUTH2_CLIENT` flag). A `FakeOauth` provider (token `user:<id>`) backs offline tests.
      Two frontends: the headless/direct `unitylan login`, and the **GUI/daemon-mediated** path — the
      daemon serves the control socket *before* enrollment (reporting `needs_login` instead of
      bailing), the GUI shows a **Log in with Discord** button (`ControlRequest::Login` → authorize
      URL), and the daemon finishes the exchange in the background + brings up the mesh once the
      browser hits the loopback. Verified: `scripts/oauth-test.sh` (direct: no-key refused → login →
      fake loopback redirect → register succeeds) and `scripts/gui-login-test.sh` (daemon-mediated:
      needs_login → `ctl login` → fake loopback redirect → daemon meshes).
- [x] **System tray** ✅ — platform-split behind `gui/src/tray/` (mirrors engine `fw`/`resolver`).
      **Linux = ksni** (StatusNotifierItem over D-Bus — native on KDE/GNOME/wayland, no gtk dep); the
      tray runs on its own thread + tokio runtime, polls the control socket to reflect connected
      state on a green/grey dot icon, and drives connect/disconnect over the socket directly — only
      show/hide-window + quit cross back into iced (over an `UnboundedReceiver<TrayMsg>` bridged via
      `Subscription::run_with_id`). Close button minimizes to tray (`exit_on_close_request(false)` +
      `close_requests()` → `change_mode(Hidden)`); tray Quit is the real exit (engine keeps running).
      **Windows = `tray-icon`** left as a documented stub (`tray/stub.rs`): it needs a Win32
      message-pump integration that can't be built/verified from the Linux host — filled in when
      Windows is worked (like macOS, deferred). **Verify:** ✅ 1 reducer test (window toggle flips
      hidden) + live D-Bus check on this KDE host — the running GUI registers on
      `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` with `Id=unitylan`, connected-state title, and a menu exporting
      `Show / hide window` · `Disconnect mesh` · `Quit`.

**Verify:** 4 reducer unit tests (status/devices/error/rename paths); launch smoke (window +
wgpu/tiny-skia renderer + timer subscription + async socket task boot clean). The socket
protocol itself is the same one `mesh-test.sh` exercises via the `ctl` CLI.

## M5 — NAT traversal
**Goal:** reach members behind NAT. Split by reachability class: *reachable* (UPnP / forward →
dialable), *cone-NAT'd* (hole punch), *symmetric-both* (relay fallback — M5.4, §7.2).
Punch architecture (settled): **coordinator-mediated + peer-observed reflexive** — reuses the
long-poll/presence/endpoint cache already built; the simultaneous long-poll wake *is* the punch
sync signal; reflexive endpoint is read from a reachable peer's view of us (no STUN server — the
WG socket is owned by boringtun, so a side-socket STUN is impossible). Note the refresh source is
useless for punch: refresh is HTTP/TCP, a different NAT mapping than the WG UDP port.

### M5.1 — UPnP + endpoint autodiscovery ✅
- [x] `nat.rs`: UPnP-IGD (`igd-next`) maps the WG UDP port, learns external `ip:port`, renews the
      lease at half-life. Best-effort: no gateway / refusal → advertise no endpoint (be dialed).
- [x] Endpoint precedence in the daemon: explicit `endpoint` (manual forward) > UPnP-mapped > none;
      the result rides every register/refresh (existing plumbing). `upnp = true` default, skipped
      when `endpoint` is set.
- **Verify:** ✅ `mesh-test.sh` green (explicit-endpoint path unchanged; UPnP skipped when set).
      Live UPnP path needs a real IGD router (or the `mock-igd` crate) — manual/opportunistic.

### M5.2 — Coordinator-mediated hole punch (cone NAT) ✅
- [x] **Spike (gate)** ✅ — defguard `read_interface_data()` exposes each peer's last-seen source
      endpoint (`Host.peers[k].endpoint`, parsed from the boringtun uapi `get` dump) on every
      backend. Peer-observed reflexive is viable.
- [x] `WgBackend::peer_endpoints()` — reads the endpoint WG last saw each peer send from. The
      daemon reports these as `RegisterReq.observed`; a reachable peer (A) thereby tells the
      coordinator every NAT'd co-member's reflexive `ip:port`. The read is retried (boringtun's
      uapi is racy under load) and re-polled every ~2s so a freshly-learned reflexive is reported
      promptly (the long-poll hold would otherwise sit on it for ~TTL/2); a failed read is treated
      as "unchanged" so it never flaps a spurious report.
- [x] API: `RegisterReq.observed: Vec<ObservedEndpoint>` + `Seed.punch: Option<SocketAddr>`.
      Coordinator caches reflexives (`AppState.reflexive`, last-writer-wins) and `punch_target`
      sets `punch` for a peer only when **neither** side is directly dialable (else the dialable
      one is reached via `endpoint`); a new/roamed reflexive bumps the version so parked peers wake.
- [x] Daemon: a seed carrying `punch` → set that peer's WG endpoint (`endpoint.or(punch)`) and
      handshake it; both sides wake on the same version bump → simultaneous open.
- **Verify:** ✅ `scripts/nat-test.sh` (3 netns, A reachable + B & C behind separate full-cone
      NATs): A observes both reflexives → coordinator pairs them → **B dials C's reflexive and C
      dials B's** (gated). Plus `punch_target` unit test. The final UDP data-plane hop (ping over
      the punched tunnel) is reported **best-effort, not gated**: Linux netns MASQUERADE/DNAT can't
      faithfully emulate an endpoint-independent NAT's simultaneous-open (conntrack clash — proven
      with a standalone raw-socket punch); real cone/full-cone routers punch fine. `mesh-test.sh`
      still green (no regression from the reflexive-reporting loop changes).

### M5.3 — NAT / reachability diagnostics ✅
- [x] Per-peer reachability classifier (`common::control::classify_reach`): a peer is `Direct`
      (dialable, or a hole punch whose WG handshake completed), `Punching` (dialing a reflexive,
      within a 30s grace window), or `Unreachable` (punch outstanding past the window with no
      handshake — the symmetric-NAT-both-ends tail, relay fallback planned in M5.4, §7.2).
- [x] `WgBackend::peer_stats()` surfaces each peer's last-seen endpoint **and** last-handshake
      time; the daemon classifies every peer each loop and overlays it onto the control-socket
      status (`control::set_reach`, cheap — no DNS/firewall work) so a stuck punch shows up even
      when nothing else changes. `StatusReport`/`PeerStatus` gain `reach`.
- [x] `ctl status` annotates a peer `[hole-punching…]` / `[unreachable: symmetric NAT?]`; the GUI
      renders the same `PeerReach` from the shared status.
- **Verify:** ✅ `classify_reach` unit test (all transitions). `nat-test.sh` surfaces the state over
      `ctl status` (informational there — netns produces a one-sided handshake so B records a
      handshake for C and reads `Direct`; the `last_handshake` liveness signal is correct on real
      networks, where a lost return path also fails the handshake). `mesh-test.sh` still green.

### M5.4 — Relay fallback (backend-agnostic) — the symmetric/CGNAT/UDP-blocked tail
**Goal:** reach pairs where punch structurally can't (both symmetric, CGNAT, or outbound-UDP
blocked). A relay forwards WG **ciphertext** between the pair; e2e stays intact (relay holds no
keys). **Transport = TURN** (`webrtc-rs turn`), chosen over a bespoke forward so the M5.5 ICE agent
reuses the same server + shim (no throwaway relay protocol). Highest-value next NAT increment
(`docs/prior-art.md` §6.3). Supersedes the old "no relay in v1" stance (design §7.2) as the planned
follow-on, not a GA blocker.

> **TURN implies a local proxy shim** (revises the old "no data-plane rewrite" note): a TURN relay
> only forwards TURN-encapsulated traffic, and boringtun emits raw UDP to a fixed endpoint. So each
> stuck peer points its WG endpoint at a local `127.0.0.1:<shim>` socket and the engine bridges those
> packets through its TURN allocation. Backend-agnostic (the shim is loopback), and the shim + server
> are exactly what M5.5 ICE needs — hence TURN now.

- [x] **Relay-peer selection + authorization** ✅ (stage 1) — coordinator matches a stuck pair to a
      relay-capable co-member and mints short-lived TURN credentials (coturn `use-auth-secret`:
      base64(HMAC-SHA1(relay_secret, "<expiry>")), `common::relay`), staying off the data path.
      `relay_target()` picks the lowest-pubkey third-party relay sharing a network with both — symmetric,
      so both sides meet on it. Members relay for members only. Unit-tested (`relay_target`, credential).
- [x] **Embedded TURN server + advertisement** ✅ (stage 2) — a dialable, opted-in node runs
      `turn::server::Server` (`engine/relay.rs`) with a `LongTermAuthHandler` over its persisted
      `relay_secret`; advertises `relay_capable`/`relay_addr` via `RegisterReq`. Config `relay`
      (default off) + `relay_port` (3478). Verified: boots "TURN server up", binds UDP :port.
- [x] **TURN client + loopback proxy shim** ✅ (stage 3) — a peer whose punch went `Unreachable`
      reports `need_relay`, gets `Seed.relay`, allocates on the relay (`turn::client::Client`), and
      bridges its WG traffic boringtun↔allocation via a `127.0.0.1:<shim>` socket (`RelayManager` in
      `engine/relay.rs`). **Relayed-address exchange** implemented: `RegisterReq.relay_allocated` +
      `RelayInfo.peer_relayed`, converging over ~2 long-poll rounds (a relay need/alloc change now
      breaks the long-poll hold, like an observed-endpoint change). `PeerReach::Relayed`; WG endpoint
      precedence endpoint > relay-shim > punch. Also fixed a latent boringtun panic: the userspace
      backend can't modify a peer in place, so `apply_seeds` now removes-then-adds on an
      endpoint/allowed-ips change (this is what an endpoint switch punch→relay triggers).
- [x] **Consent / DoS surface** ✅ — opt-in via `relay = false` default; plus a **concurrent-allocation
      cap** (`relay_max_allocations`, default 64) enforced in the TURN server's auth handler
      (`CappedAuth` counts distinct client 5-tuples, decrements via `alloc_close_notify`) so an
      authorized member still can't spend an unbounded share of the relay's uplink. Unit-tested
      (cap limits new clients, allows refreshes, refuses expired creds). A finer per-allocation
      *bandwidth* cap would need forking `webrtc-rs turn`'s data path — deferred, not GA-blocking.
- **Verify:** ✅ `scripts/relay-test.sh` — 3 netns (A public+relay, B & C behind NATs whose externals
      are firewall-isolated from each other so the punch structurally can't complete): B & C go
      `Unreachable`, allocate on A's TURN server, exchange relayed addresses, and **ping B→C over the
      relay succeeds** (gated — TURN's client↔server leg is one conntrack-friendly flow, so it
      traverses netns NAT reliably, unlike the punch). `ctl status` shows `[relayed]`. Relay carries WG
      ciphertext by construction (boringtun frames; the relay holds no keys). `mesh-test.sh` +
      `nat-test.sh` still green. **Remaining:** the consent/DoS rate-caps item above (not GA-blocking).

### M5.5 — Side-socket ICE (userspace) — STUN bootstrap + ICE + TURN via crates
**Goal:** on the userspace path, replace the ad-hoc peer-observed punch with a real ICE agent,
reusing mature Rust libs (`webrtc-rs` `ice`/`stun`/`turn`) on a socket beside boringtun
(`docs/prior-art.md` §6.2). Gets STUN reflexive (fixes **bootstrap** — a lone/all-NAT'd mesh with
no online observer, which peer-observed can't start), host/srflx candidates, and TURN relay
(= M5.4) for little code. Userspace-only (owns the socket); **kernel backends (Windows) keep punch +
M5.4 relay** — full ICE-on-Windows waits for the Post-GA userspace-Windows (Wintun) backend; until
then a Windows node behind bad NAT degrades to the M5.4 relay in exactly the cases ICE would improve
(no functional hole, just a directness/perf gap). **STUN hosting = relay-first, coordinator-host
fallback**: a stuck peer STUNs a dialable relay co-member (decentralized, coordinator off-path) and
falls back to a responder on the coordinator host when none is online.

- [x] **Stage 0 — spike / gate** ✅ — proved `webrtc-ice`'s `Agent` connects two peers with
      candidates + ufrag/pwd exchanged **out-of-band** (post-gather, the coordinator-long-poll shape,
      not the crate's built-in signaling), yields a `webrtc_util::Conn`, and carries bytes both ways
      (`crates/engine/tests/ice_spike.rs`). Handoff viable: that `Conn` is the same `webrtc_util::Conn`
      trait `RelaySession` already pumps (restricted-cone reuses the shim pump); full-cone reads the
      selected pair's remote addr → sets the WG endpoint. **STUN is free on relay nodes**: the M5.4
      `turn::server::Server` already answers STUN Binding (XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS, unauthenticated), so the
      relay-node half needs no extra server — only the coordinator-host fallback responder is new.
      Dep `webrtc-ice = "0.17"` added (pairs with our `turn`/`webrtc-util`/`stun` 0.17).
- [x] **Stage 1 — control plane: candidate exchange** ✅ — `common::api` gains `IceParams`
      (ufrag/pwd + marshaled candidates) + `IceEndpoint` (per-peer offer); `RegisterReq.ice` carries
      a device's offers, `Seed.ice` returns the peer's. Coordinator `AppState.ice` is an
      `(owner, peer) → IceParams` table (mirrors `relay_allocs`): the register handler records
      `req.ice`, bumps the version only on a changed offer (fresh candidates / ICE-restart creds — no
      herd otherwise), and hands each seed the peer's `(peer, caller)` offer. Pure relay — the
      coordinator never runs ICE, so the data path stays P2P. Engine still sends `ice: []` (gathering
      is stage 3). Compiles across all three crates.
- [x] **Stage 2 — STUN fallback responder** ✅ — `coordinator/src/stun.rs`: a stateless,
      unauthenticated UDP STUN Binding responder (answers with the caller's `XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS`,
      the exact reflexive a relay node's `turn::server` already returns). Config `stun_bind`
      (`Option<SocketAddr>`, default off) starts it as a detached task; its address is advertised in
      `RegisterResp.stun_addr` so the ICE agent can use it as the server-reflexive fallback when no
      relay co-member is online to STUN. Off the data path (control-plane-only). 2 unit tests
      (echoes reflexive + transaction id; ignores non-Binding). Client-side gather (relay-first,
      coord fallback) is built into the agent config in stage 3.
- [x] **Stage 3 — ICE agent + data-plane handoff** ✅ — `engine/ice.rs`: an `IceManager` (mirrors
      `RelayManager`) runs one `webrtc-ice` `Agent` per stuck peer on a side socket, gathering
      host/srflx/relay candidates (`build_urls`: relay-first STUN + the peer's `Seed.relay` as the
      TURN candidate), feeding the peer's candidates in as they trickle over refreshes, running
      checks (min-pubkey dials), and on success **pumping boringtun↔ICE `Conn` through a
      `127.0.0.1:<shim>` socket** — the `Conn` already routes over the best validated pair (direct
      srflx when one works, relay only as a last resort). Wired into the daemon: gated to the
      userspace backend (`WgBackend::is_userspace()`; kernel keeps M5.4 relay — running both would
      double-allocate); reports `ice.offers()` via `RegisterReq.ice` with change-breaks-the-hold like
      `observed`; `sync_ice` creates/feeds sessions for the stuck set; endpoint precedence is now
      `endpoint > ice-shim > relay-shim > punch`. **Handoff seam:** the always-pump approach (vs. the
      "set WG endpoint direct" optimization for endpoint-independent pairs) is deliberate — the
      localhost hop is negligible and pumping is correct for every NAT combo ICE can traverse; the
      direct-endpoint optimization is magicsock territory (prior-art §6.5, deferred). Compiles;
      `build_urls` unit-tested; `mesh-test.sh` still PASS (no regression to the direct path).
      **Follow-up (stage 4):** ICE currently triggers on the `Unreachable` stuck set, which covers
      restricted-cone/symmetric but **not** pure bootstrap (no observer → `classify_reach` reads
      `Direct`, never `Unreachable`); a bootstrap trigger needs a "non-dialable, unpunchable, unconnected
      after grace" gate.
- [x] **Stage 4 — status polish + bootstrap trigger + verify** ✅ — `PeerReach::Ice` (`ctl status`
      shows `[ice]`; the GUI carries it). Bootstrap trigger added: a peer with no endpoint *and* no
      punch target (no observer reported a reflexive) that hasn't connected is tracked separately and,
      after a 15s grace, run through ICE (userspace) — `classify_reach` reads such a peer as `Direct`,
      so it never becomes `Unreachable` on its own. New `ice` config (default on) gates the userspace
      ICE path; **off** falls back to the M5.2 punch + M5.4 relay (the escape hatch, and how the M5.4
      relay path stays exercised on Linux — `relay-test.sh` now pins `ice = false`).
- **Verify:** ✅ `scripts/ice-test.sh` — 3 netns (A public+relay, B & C behind NATs whose externals
      are firewall-isolated from each other): B & C go `Unreachable`, each runs a side-socket ICE
      agent, gathers host + srflx (STUN A) + relay (TURN A) candidates, exchanges them over the
      long-poll, and the **relay↔relay pair validates → ping B→C succeeds over the ICE path** (gated);
      `ctl status` shows `[ice]`. `relay-test.sh` (M5.4, `ice = false`), `nat-test.sh` (punch),
      `mesh-test.sh` all still PASS — no regression. Restricted-cone *direct*-pair selection and the
      pure-bootstrap (no relay peer) case can't be faithfully emulated in netns (same NAT limitation
      as the M5.2 punch data-plane) — real networks select the direct srflx pair when one validates.
- **Note:** leaves a residual gap (efficient direct paths through restricted-cone NAT; UDP-blocked
      networks) that only **in-socket magicsock** closes — deferred to Post-GA (prior-art §6.4/§6.5).

## M6 — DNS + multi-homing
**Goal:** `*.internal` names resolve on the OS; overlapping networks work on one interface.
- [x] `dns.rs`: `.internal` authoritative resolver from verified attestations — built in M-device ch5.
- [x] **Per-OS resolver hookup (Linux)** ✅ — `resolver.rs`: `ResolverHook` trait + systemd-resolved
      backend (`ResolvectlHook`). On iface-up the daemon points resolved at our resolver via a
      **per-link `~internal` routing domain** (`resolvectl dns <iface> <server>` + `domain <iface>
      ~internal`), so only `*.internal` lookups go to us — global DNS untouched. Reverted on clean
      shutdown (`resolvectl revert`); also clears with the link. `resolver_hook = true` default,
      best-effort (needs privilege — the daemon already runs privileged; a failure only means names
      don't auto-resolve). The resolver binds this device's own mesh IP on :53 (`dns` flag; own-IP
      keeps :53 free everywhere and satisfies NRPT) and resolved routes to it because the wg iface is
      operational (carries its `/32`) — resolved ignores per-link DNS on a non-operational link.
      macOS `/etc/resolver` is a future backend behind the trait.
- [x] **Per-OS resolver hookup (Windows)** ✅ (M-win2) — `resolver/windows.rs`: `NrptHook` drives the
      Name Resolution Policy Table via PowerShell (`Add-DnsClientNrptRule -Namespace '.internal'
      -NameServers <ip>` / `Remove-DnsClientNrptRule`). NRPT is namespace-scoped (system-wide), not
      link-scoped — same split-horizon effect as resolved's routing domain. Every rule carries
      `-Comment UnityLAN`, so `install` clears stale rules then re-adds (idempotent) and `revert`
      removes only ours. Two NRPT constraints vs. Linux: nameservers are port-53-only (`install`
      errors if the resolver isn't on :53 — the daemon always uses :53), and rules persist across an unclean exit (self-healed by the
      clear-on-install). `resolver.rs` split into `resolver/{mod,linux,windows}.rs` mirroring `fw/`;
      `platform_hook()` now selects resolved (Linux) vs NRPT (Windows). Needs elevation.
- [x] **Multi-homing / cross-network isolation** ✅ — obsolete under **Model B** (design §6): one
      device IP in a flat `100.64/10`, networks are pure ACL. Isolation is already enforced by
      seed-scoping (you only peer co-members sharing ≥1 network) + the firewall's `--net` source
      scoping (M7c-2), not per-role `/32`s.
- [x] **Namespace rename `.internal` → `.unity.internal`** ✅ — code now matches design (header + §6).
      Flipped `common::DNS_SUFFIX` (`crates/common/src/lib.rs`) `"internal"` → `"unity.internal"`; the
      `hostname` / `primary_alias` builders (`attestation.rs`) cascade from it. Killed the drift-prone
      hardcodes by wiring them to the shared const: resolver `DOMAIN` consts (`resolver/linux.rs`,
      `resolver/windows.rs`) are now `= common::DNS_SUFFIX` (→ `~unity.internal` / `.unity.internal`),
      and `dns.rs`'s zone check is `ends_with(&format!(".{}", common::DNS_SUFFIX))`. Updated the
      `.internal` test fixtures/comments across `attestation.rs`, `dns.rs`, `gui/src/main.rs` and
      scripts (`mesh-test.sh`, `gui-login-test.sh`, `resolver-hook-test.sh`). **Verify:** ✅
      `mesh-test.sh` resolves `host-b.nodeb.lan.unity.internal` + `nodeb.lan.unity.internal` alias →
      B's IP (live PASS); 60 unit tests green (fmt/clippy/test). `resolver-hook-test.sh` (root) updated
      to query `.unity.internal` — not re-run here (needs elevation).

**Verify:** ✅ 2 `resolver/linux.rs` unit tests (resolvectl arg construction) + 2 `resolver/windows.rs`
tests (NRPT script construction); `scripts/resolver-hook-test.sh` (live, root) — on this host's real
systemd-resolved, scoped to a throwaway link: the daemon's actual `ResolvectlHook` routes `.internal`
and `resolvectl query host-a.alice.lan.internal → 100.64.0.9`, then reverts. `mesh-test.sh` still
green (in-netns the hook warns best-effort — no resolved there). Windows NRPT: builds + unit tests
pass on Windows; the `resolver-install`/`resolver-revert` dev subcommands drive the real `NrptHook`,
and the port-53 guard errors cleanly. Live NRPT rule install + `.internal` resolution needs an
elevated box. macOS `/etc/resolver` still deferred.

---

## M7 — Revocation, expose, status polish
**Goal:** losing a role cuts you off; expose local ports; solid status.

### M7a — Revocation core ✅
- [x] **Client prune**: `apply_seeds` removes peers absent from the current seed set (was
      add-only). A revoked/departed co-member drops out of the coordinator's presence → its
      next-absent refresh removes the peer + reinstalls routing. Grant→None mid-loop (own role
      lost) prunes every peer, isolating us.
- [x] **Coordinator stop-signing + self-eviction**: `build_snapshot` skips networks the caller
      no longer holds (no grant/seed) *and* evicts the caller's stale presence from any network
      it dropped, bumping the version so parked long-polls wake and prune. `Presence::evict` /
      `evict_user` / `networks_of` (unit-tested).
- [x] Client TTL refresh at half-life — already via the long-poll hold (~TTL/2); revocation
      propagates on the next woken refresh.
- **Verify:** ✅ `mesh-test.sh` — after the mesh pings, node B's role is stripped and the
  coordinator restarts; node A prunes peer B (log + `ctl status` no longer lists it).

### M7b — Live gateway revocation (immediate, prod trigger) ✅
- [x] Gateway `MEMBER_UPDATE`/`MEMBER_REMOVE` (GUILD_MEMBERS intent) → `presence.evict_user` for
      every network whose role the member no longer holds + version bump → parked long-polls wake
      and prune instantly, even when the revoked node is offline. `presence`/`version` wired into
      the gateway task. Verified-by-construction (compiles against twilight's event model); no
      headless test — needs a live Discord guild.
- [ ] Optional persisted tombstones (survive coordinator restart before the live role re-check) —
      deferred: the live role re-check on re-register already blocks a revoked member.

### M7c — expose (enforcing firewall)
- [x] **Firewall core** ✅ — `FirewallBackend` trait + Linux nftables backend (`inet unitylan`,
      atomic `nft -f -` load). Default-deny new inbound on the wg iface; allow established/related
      + ICMP echo; accept only exposed ports. On by default (`firewall = true`); fail-closed at
      startup if nft errors. Backend-agnostic so Windows WFP / macOS pf drop in later (both kernel
      and userspace WG deliver decrypted packets through the OS stack, so the rules are identical).
- [x] `ctl expose <port> [tcp|udp]` / `unexpose` / `exposes` over the control socket → `Firewall`
      reconciles the whole ruleset; config `[[expose]]` seeds initial ports. Clean shutdown
      (ctrl_c) tears the table down.
- **Verify:** ✅ `mesh-test.sh` firewall phase — 9001 blocked by default-deny, reachable after
      `ctl expose 9001`, never-exposed 9002 stays blocked, blocked again after `unexpose`; ping
      (ICMP) survives throughout. Plus 2 nft ruleset unit tests.
- [x] **`--net <role>` source scoping** ✅ (M7c-2): `expose <port> --net <role>` opens the port
      only to that network's peers. `Seed.networks` (per-peer shared-network names) added to the
      API; the client groups peer IPs per network (`peers_by_net`, refreshed each membership
      change) and nft emits a named `ipv4_addr` source set + `ip saddr @set … dport … accept`.
      `--net` is validated against the device's held networks. **Verify:** ✅
      `scripts/expose-net-test.sh` — 3 nodes / 2 nets (A∈{mesh,mesh2}, B∈mesh, C∈mesh2): B reaches
      A's mesh-scoped 9001 but not mesh2-scoped 9002; C the reverse; expose to a non-held network
      is rejected. Plus 2 nft scoped-ruleset unit tests.
- [x] **Windows firewall backend** (M-win): `WindowsFwBackend` drives Windows Defender Firewall via
      PowerShell `New-NetFirewallRule`/`Remove-NetFirewallRule` (group `UnityLAN`), each rule an
      inbound-allow scoped to the wg iface (`-InterfaceAlias`), `--net` exposes carrying
      `-RemoteAddress` peer sets. Relies on the OS's stateful default-deny-inbound for the base
      policy. `fw::default_backend()` selects nft (unix) vs this (Windows). 3 arg-construction unit
      tests. macOS pf still a future backend.

### M7d — status polish ✅
- [x] GUI surfaces the firewall: an **exposed ports** section (proto/port + `→ net:` scope) with
      per-row **unexpose** buttons and an **expose** row (port `25565` or `udp/34197`, optional
      net). Auto-refreshed on the 2s tick over the same control socket the CLI uses.
- [x] Revocation events show implicitly — a pruned peer drops out of the auto-refreshed peers
      list. **Verify:** 4 new GUI reducer tests (exposes list / valid submit clears inputs / bad
      port surfaces error / `parse_port`); launch smoke clean. 36 unit tests total.

---

## M8 — Native kernel backends (optimization)
**Goal:** faster path where the OS offers it.

> **Direction note (2026-07, `docs/prior-art.md` §6.1):** the data plane is converging on
> **userspace-primary** — userspace is the only backend spanning Linux/Windows/**macOS/iOS/Android**
> (no kernel WG exists on macOS or mobile), and owning the socket keeps in-socket NAT traversal
> (magicsock) reachable. For the gaming/light-file workload the userspace throughput ceiling is
> ample. **Kernel backends are now an optional per-OS perf boost, not the target**; Linux netlink
> (below) is **deferred** accordingly. Windows wg-nt already landed but may later be replaced by
> userspace boringtun + Wintun (Post-GA) to collapse to one data plane.
- [x] **Windows WireGuardNT** (M-win): `wg/windows.rs` `KernelBackend` drives defguard's
      `WGApi<Kernel>` (wireguard-nt). Since defguard's Windows `configure_peer`/`remove_peer` are
      no-ops, it holds the desired iface + peer state and re-applies the full `configure_interface`
      on every change (endpoint-less peers skipped — wireguard-nt requires an endpoint).
      `wg::new_backend()` selects userspace (unix) vs this (Windows). Needs elevation + `wireguard.dll`.
- [ ] `wg/native.rs`: Linux netlink; select native when present, else userspace; parity tests.
      **Deferred** per the direction note — optional perf boost, not on the critical path.

**Verify:** same behavior as userspace on Linux + Windows, measurably lower overhead.

---

## Cross-cutting (ongoing)
- [x] `tracing` logging across binaries — both binaries init `tracing_subscriber` + `EnvFilter`
      (coordinator/engine `main.rs`, engine `service.rs`); ~44 `info!/warn!/error!` sites.
- [~] Per-OS service packaging (systemd unit · **Windows Service** ✅ · launchd plist).
      **Windows Service** landed (M-win2): `service.rs` wraps the engine as a `LocalSystem`
      auto-start service via the `windows-service` crate. `service install [config.toml]` registers
      it (config canonicalized to an absolute path + baked into the SCM command line, since a service
      runs with CWD=System32); `service uninstall` stops + deletes; `service run` is the SCM entry
      (dispatcher → control handler translating Stop/Shutdown into the daemon's shutdown signal). The
      daemon's shutdown was refactored off `ctrl_c()` onto a shared `shutdown::Shutdown` (watch-based,
      fire-once) so console mode (Ctrl-C) and the service (SCM Stop) share one path. Service logs to
      `unitylan-engine-service.log` next to the exe (no console). `WINDOWS_SERVICE_NAME` lives in
      `common`. **GUI service control — removed.** M-win2 briefly gave the GUI an "engine" section that
      queried the SCM (`gui/src/svc.rs`) and could **start** the engine, backed by an install-time DACL
      relaxation. It was dropped: the engine is meant to stay **resident** (auto-start service in a
      packaged install, or the dev-run script), and the GUI's *only* on/off is a mesh connect/disconnect
      over the control socket (needs no SCM access) — so the GUI never manages the process lifecycle. It
      now shows the live mesh UI when the socket is up, and a plain "engine not reachable, retrying"
      notice when it isn't (no process control, no "install the service" nag). `svc.rs` and the GUI's
      `windows-service` dep are gone. Still TODO: an MSI/WiX installer to bundle engine+gui+`wireguard.dll`,
      register the service, and write a default config; systemd + launchd packaging. Follow-up: with GUI
      start/stop gone, `RELAXED_DACL` (`sc.exe sdset` in `service.rs`) is no longer needed at all — the
      service can keep the SCM default DACL.
- [x] CI: `cargo fmt`/`clippy`/`test` — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the three gates
      (`fmt --all --check`, `clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings`, `test --workspace`);
      `release.yml` builds artifacts.
- [x] Endpoint-record spoof hardening ✅ — the coordinator accepts a peer-observed reflexive
      (`RegisterReq.observed`) only for a pubkey the caller actually meshes with (a co-member seed),
      via `accepted_reflexives`. Was: any authenticated member could write an arbitrary endpoint for
      any device → redirect that device's co-members' WG punch target to an attacker-chosen address
      (DoS + a "point a member's handshakes at arbitrary ip:port" reflector; no confidentiality break
      — WG auths by pubkey). Now bounded to the network trust boundary (a victim's own co-members).
      Verified: `reflexive_reports_accepted_only_for_comembers` unit test; `nat-test.sh` still green.
- [x] Coordinator key rotation ✅ — signed `prev → new` rotation certs (`RotationCert`, signed by
      the outgoing key) served as an ordered chain in every `RegisterResp`; a client whose pin is
      superseded walks the chain (verifying each hop under the key it already trusts) and re-pins to
      the current anchor without manual steps. Multi-hop, so a client offline across several
      rotations still catches up; a gap the chain can't bridge is refused (MITM preserved → manual
      re-pin). Trigger: offline `coordinator rotate-key <config>` admin subcommand + restart.
      Verified: 5 `walk_chain` unit tests (multi-hop, forged-cert, rollback, no-path);
      `scripts/rotation-test.sh` end-to-end (TOFU pin → A→B→C re-pin → unrelated-key refusal);
      `mesh-test.sh` still green.
- All GA-blocker design items (design.md Open Questions) are now closed: symmetric-NAT policy,
  pubkey re-key signal, coordinator key rotation. Remaining pre-GA work is packaging/perf, below.
- [x] Pubkey re-key signal ✅ — a re-keyed device passes its old device token as `supersede`; the
      coordinator authenticates ownership and retires the old pubkey at once (drops the device row,
      evicts presence). A presence reaper (`PRESENCE_TTL_SECS`) backstops it and any unclean drop
      (crashed/dropped client) that would otherwise linger until coordinator restart. Verified:
      `should_supersede` + `reap_evicts_only_stale_entries` +
      `record_refreshes_last_seen_without_reporting_change` unit tests; `mesh-test.sh` still green.
- [x] Symmetric-NAT policy ✅ — v1 ships best-effort + `[unreachable: symmetric NAT?]` diagnostic;
      ciphertext relay is the planned follow-on (M5.4, design.md §7.2), not a GA blocker. System
      already degrades cleanly; no code change for the v1 diagnostic.

## Post-GA
- [→] Symmetric-NAT-both relay — **promoted to M5.4** (now the planned next NAT increment, not
      Post-GA): data-plane forward through a common mesh peer, ciphertext-only, backend-agnostic.
      See M5.4 for the task breakdown.
- [ ] **In-socket magicsock (userspace)** — multiplex STUN/DISCO onto the WG socket to close the
      side-socket residual (`docs/prior-art.md` §6.5): truly-direct paths through restricted-cone
      NAT (no proxy hop), single-socket firewall footprint, and :443/HTTPS relay for UDP-hostile
      networks. Bespoke — only if the M5.5 residual bites. Requires driving boringtun `Tunn` on our
      own `Bind` (dropping `defguard_wireguard_rs`'s device layer).
- [ ] **Userspace Windows backend (Wintun)** — boringtun + Wintun TUN on Windows
      (`defguard_wireguard_rs`'s userspace path is unix-only), replacing the wg-nt dependency.
      Prerequisite for magicsock-on-Windows and for collapsing to a single data plane
      (prior-art §6.1).
- [ ] **macOS + mobile clients** — userspace + utun (macOS) / NetworkExtension (iOS) / VpnService
      (Android). Userspace is *mandatory* there — no kernel WG exists. Unlocked by the
      userspace-primary direction (prior-art §6.1, §8).
- [ ] **Tailnet-lock-style co-signature** (prior-art §7) — optional admin/peer co-signature on a
      new device's attestation so a compromised coordinator alone can't inject a peer. Hardens the
      single-anchor trust root; fail-closed. Secure-by-default aligned.
- [ ] **Multi-coordinator client (federated meshes)** — a client trusts >1 coordinator at once,
      so a user in guilds served by *different* self-hosters isn't forced to pick. Builds on the
      per-deployment mesh CIDR already shipped (each coordinator owns a disjoint `/16`, default
      hashed from its anchor, or an explicit `cidr`). Two rungs, both client-only (coordinators stay
      mutually ignorant — decentralization-clean):
      1. **Profile store + in-client switch** — persist N `(url, pinned anchor, cidr)` profiles, one
         *active* at a time; instant switch (anchor pre-pinned, just re-drive the interface). No IP
         collision because one mesh drives the interface at a time. Also extends the join-time LAN
         overlap check to warn on **cross-coordinator** CIDR overlap (misconfig).
      2. **Concurrent meshes** — all pinned meshes live at once. Unicast composes on one interface
         (disjoint CIDRs → unambiguous routes); **separate interface per mesh** is needed only to
         isolate broadcast (game LAN discovery `255.255.255.255`) between simultaneously-gamed
         meshes. Degrades to switch-between when two of a user's coordinators hash to the same block.
      Constraint that makes this *switch-first*: games need a flat IPv4 LAN (broadcast + IPv4-only
      binaries) and sovereign coordinators can't share one IPv4 authority — so concurrent-flat-IPv4
      is bounded by construction (`docs/design.md` "IPv4-only for now"). IPv6-ULA-per-anchor is the
      only path to unbounded concurrency and stays parked as the design's additive dual-stack option.
- [ ] **Discord coordinator auto-discovery** — each self-hoster's bot advertises its own endpoint
      URL (e.g. a `/unitylan join` response) so a member auto-populates the coordinator profile
      (above) with no hand-typed URL. Inherently decentralized: the guild is the namespace, no
      central directory. Trust stays sovereign — advertise the **URL only**, show the anchor
      fingerprint for out-of-band verification on first pin (never let Discord distribute the anchor
      key). Off the long-poll hot path (user-initiated interaction response), so cheap on the
      north-star. **Do not** add a well-known bootstrap address or global registry — that would
      recreate a privileged main instance.
- [ ] **Coordinator release auto-poll (opt-in)** — the coordinator periodically polls GitHub
      Releases for the latest tag + `SHA256SUMS`, auto-builds and signs the release manifest, and
      hot-swaps it (the SIGHUP reload path already does the swap). Replaces the admin's manual
      `[release]` edit + SIGHUP. Cheap on the north-star: **one** outbound poll per interval,
      independent of client count — no fan-out, off the data plane. The tradeoff is **trust, not
      traffic**: auto-poll signs (with the deployment anchor) whatever GitHub's latest release
      advertises, so no human vets each one — a compromised GitHub release/tag would auto-propagate
      to the whole mesh. Therefore **off by default, behind a config flag**; the shipped manual +
      SIGHUP flow keeps a human in the loop (see `packaging/README.md` "Signed auto-update").
- [ ] **Trusted networks + LAN game discovery** — let a user flag a network as *trusted* to run
      LAN-aware games (Warcraft III–style) across the mesh. Two layers, and the cheap one is nearly
      worthless without the expensive one:
      1. **Firewall relaxation (cheap, ~1 unit).** Client-local per-network `trusted` flag mirroring
         the existing opt-out pattern (`SetNetwork`/`LocalNet`/`netcfg.rs`): new `trusted.json` set,
         `SetNetworkTrusted` control msg, a `saddr @net_<name> accept` rule before the default drop
         in `fw/nftables.rs` + `fw/windows.rs`, and a GUI toggle in `networks_section`. Firewall
         stays default-deny; trusted is opt-in relaxation (secure-by-default aligned). **Unlocks
         direct-connect-by-IP only** (WC3 has this) — leaves auto-discovery empty.
      2. **Broadcast/multicast relay (the real feature, ~5–10× layer 1 + a platform dep).** Classic
         LAN discovery is UDP broadcast (`255.255.255.255`) / multicast (mDNS `224.0.0.251`), which
         does **not** traverse the routed point-to-point WG mesh — so layer 1 alone gives an empty
         server browser. A relay must capture a local game's *outgoing* broadcast, unicast it to each
         trusted peer, and re-inject it as arriving broadcast on their side. **No hook exists:**
         `defguard_wireguard_rs` owns the TUN on both backends and the `WgBackend` trait is
         control-plane only (no packet read/write/inject) — by design (engine stays off the data
         plane). So this punches the engine into the packet path for the first time, via a raw
         capture/inject subsystem *beside* the wg iface (can't tap defguard without forking it).
         Linux is moderate (AF_PACKET, root already held); **Windows is the scope bomb** — an
         ordinary UDP socket can't see another process's outgoing broadcast, so it needs **Npcap**
         (new external dep, installer bundling, redistribution licensing) or a **WFP callout driver**
         (signed kernel driver). Plus loop-prevention tagging, a dst/port relay filter, IGMP joins,
         trusted-net scoping, and netns-harness coverage for injected broadcast. Note the
         concurrent-multi-coordinator item above already flags that isolating `255.255.255.255`
         between simultaneously-gamed meshes needs a **separate interface per mesh** — same broadcast
         constraint, different axis. Ship layer 1 only if direct-IP-by-hand is judged worth it on its
         own; otherwise treat the pair as one milestone gated on the relay.
- [ ] **Peer-to-peer file sharing** — send/receive files directly between peers over the mesh, with
      no Discord upload-size cap in the way. Rides the existing P2P tunnel + `.unity.internal` names
      (transfer targets a peer by hostname/IP; the coordinator stays off the path — pure data plane,
      north-star-clean). Firewall: a transfer needs an inbound listener, so either an ephemeral
      auto-`expose` scoped to the sender's IP (torn down after) or a reserved port opened only to
      co-members. Open scope: transport (a small QUIC/HTTP listener in the engine vs. an out-of-band
      helper), sender/receiver consent UX in the GUI, and resumable/large-file chunking.
